<h1 id="exercise-5">Exercise 5</h1>
<p>In lecture we saw that 1D arrays are stored contiguously in memory. How are 2D arrays stored? How about 3D arrays?</p>
<p>The isSymetric method we saw in the videos is redundant. Modify it so there are no redundant “checks”.</p>
<p>Implement a getDiagonal method which takes a matrix as input. What should the return type be?</p>
<p>In the videos I said that my addMatrix could have an issue. What is one potential problem?</p>
<p>Implement a matrix multiplication method. That is, write a method which takes in a nxm matrix and a mxk matrix, and returns their product.</p>
<p>Consider a char[][] which respresents the state of a connect four game. Each cell can be one of ’ ', ‘R’, or ‘B’. Where ’ ’ respresents the spot is open, ‘R’ is red, and ‘B’ is black. What sort of methods could you write for this? Consider the two below:</p>
<p>public static void makeMove(char[][], int column, char colour){<br>
//Implement me<br>
}</p>
<p>public static boolean containsWin(char[][]){<br>
//Implement me<br>
}</p>
<p>Play around with the student Class. Do some research on get and set (slectors and mutators). Why would we want to use these instead of just making a variable public? You can make methods private. What is the point of that?</p>
